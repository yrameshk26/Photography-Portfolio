# Installation

## New Grav site

1. Download the latest release in this repository.
2. Unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Access your site via web browser.

## Existing Grav site

You can just install [Multiverse theme](https://github.com/tranduyhung/grav-theme-multiverse), but page content will need to reference the Multiverse theme's supported templates. It is strongly advised to at least install the Multiverse skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install multiverse
```
